# Setup spring boot application

Simplest way to create "netbeans" ready project is to create project zip file with [spring web wizard](http://start.spring.io) and unpack it somewhere. Open the wizard page and switch to the full version.

After you click on "Generate project" or press Alt+Return, you will get zip file "save as" dialog. This file is created with all necessary configurations to start developing web application. Â  Just extract it somewhere and open project folder from netbeans.

Created project is [**maven**](http://bisaga.com/blog/programming/maven-installation/) project with "pom.xml" definition file, you will need [maven installed](http://bisaga.com/blog/programming/maven-installation/) on your system.
