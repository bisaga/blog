# Create new component with CLI

To create new component run **ng generate** command. This command has ability to generate different entities of your angular application like components, modules, interfaces, services, etc.  If you generate component, your angular application will  be updated to include newly generated component automatically.

$ ng generate component component\_name
$ ng g c component\_name
